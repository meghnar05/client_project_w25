            <p>Around 4,000 students at the University of Michigan are the first in their families to attend college. While this can feel overwhelming, it's also an exciting and important milestone. Fortunately, U-M offers valuable programs and networks to help first-generation students build connections and succeed on campus. This website provides the tools you need to discover resources, find your community, and settle into college life. Make U-M your home and take advantage of these opportunities!</p>

            <h2>What is a first gen student?</h2>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, undergraduate and graduate students are first-generation college students if neither of their parents or guardians has earned a four-year college or university degree. This also applies to students with other relatives, such as siblings, cousins, or grandparents, who have completed a four-year degree.</p>
